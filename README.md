Welcome to Coin Cafeteria

This project was created using React/Javascript in the front end and Ruby on Rails in the back end.

To start , you need to either create a user/ or login to a current user.

Once logged in, you will see a list of cryptocurrencies.

You can sort these currencies by either name, price, or percent change.

You can search for a coin by the name as well.

You can add coins or remove coins from your favorites.

You can click the Show More Info tab to see news articles and more information about a certain coin.

Thanks for checking out my website!
